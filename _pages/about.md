My name is Tobias Rebholz. I am a quantitative psychologist and econometrician, currently working as a visiting research scholar in the <a href="https://areas.fuqua.duke.edu/management/index.html">Management and Organizations Area</a> at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, in North Carolina, USA. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href='https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/174183' target="_blank">Social Cognition and Decision Sciences</a> group at the University of Tübingen's Psychology Department in Germany. I earned my PhD in 2023 from the DFG-funded Research Training Group <i>Statistical Modeling in Psychology</i> (<a href='https://www.uni-mannheim.de/smip/team/phd-candidates/cohort-2020/tobias-rebholz/' target="_blank">SMiP</a>), a transregional collaboration of researchers from the Universities of Mannheim, Freiburg, Heidelberg, Landau, and Tübingen. 

Most of my research focuses on quantitative methods in social cognition and judgment and decision-making (JDM). My doctoral thesis on <i>Advanced Statistical Modeling of Ecological Constraints in Information Sampling and Utilization</i> is avilable at <a href='http://doi.org/10.15496/publikation-83023' target="_blank">http://doi.org/10.15496/publikation-83023</a>. Currently, I am working on extending this work to human-computer interaction, developing methods to examine how users sample and utilize information from large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. My primary focus is on addressing the challenge of quantifying the informational influence of these models' often qualitative output on human JDM.

More details about my research are available on this website and in my [CV](/cv/). Feel free to reach out with any questions at <a href='mailto:tr.rebholz@gmail.com'>tr.rebholz@gmail.com</a>!
