## How do people make judgments and decisions when the information they rely on is noisy and incomplete—and how is this changing in the age of AI?

Tobias R. Rebholz is a quantitative psychologist and econometrician addressing these questions using methods from statistics, machine learning, and behavioral science, including human-computer interaction and artificial cognition experiments. He is currently a DFG-funded Walter Benjamin Fellow and visiting research scholar in the <a href="https://areas.fuqua.duke.edu/management/index.html" target="_blank">Management and Organizations Area</a> at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. Previously, he was a research associate in the <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/174183" target="_blank">Social Cognition and Decision Sciences</a> group in the Department of Psychology at the University of Tübingen in Germany. He earned his PhD in 2023 from the DFG-funded Research Training Group Statistical Modeling in Psychology (<a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/smip/team/alumni/dr-tobias-rebholz/" target="_blank">SMiP</a>)—a transregional collaboration involving the Universities of Mannheim, Freiburg, Heidelberg, Landau, and Tübingen.

Tobias' research focuses on quantitative methods for behavioral research in social cognition and judgment and decision-making (JDM). A central theme in his current work is quantifying the informational influence of qualitative information—especially that generated by large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini—on human JDM. More broadly, he develops and applies advanced statistical models to understand how ecological constraints shape information sampling and utilization. His research has secured more than 150,000 EUR in competitive funding and has been published in peer-reviewed outlets such as Psychological Inquiry, Judgment and Decision Making, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied.

Beyond academia, Tobias is trained as a professional chef (see <a href="/culinary/">Culinary</a> corner for details). He was in one of the first cohorts of the unique double-degree program "<a href="https://foerderverein-lize.de/lize-koch/" target="_blank">LIZE-Koch: Gesellenbrief + Abitur</a>", which has since become an established program at his former German high school. He worked as a sous-chef at <a href="https://donauperle.com/" target="_blank">Restaurant Donauperle</a> for a couple of years and as a restaurant critic for <a href="https://www.bodensee.de/erleben/seezunge" target="_blank">Seezunge</a>, a local gourmet guide in the Lake Constance region. Although he no longer cooks professionally, he continues to volunteer in various culinary roles—for example, cooking for youth and community programs.
