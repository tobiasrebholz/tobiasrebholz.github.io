My name is <b>Tobias R. Rebholz</b>, and I am a quantitative psychologist and econometrician. I currently serve as a visiting research scholar in the <a href="https://areas.fuqua.duke.edu/management/index.html">Management and Organizations Area</a> at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, in North Carolina, USA. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href='https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/174183' target="_blank">Social Cognition and Decision Sciences</a> group at the Department of Psychology, University of Tübingen, Germany. 

I earned my PhD in 2023 from the DFG-funded Research Training Group <i>Statistical Modeling in Psychology</i> (<a href='https://www.uni-mannheim.de/smip/team/phd-candidates/cohort-2020/tobias-rebholz/' target="_blank">SMiP</a>)—a transregional collaboration involving the Universities of Mannheim, Freiburg, Heidelberg, Landau, and Tübingen. My doctoral dissertation, titled <i>Advanced Statistical Modeling of Ecological Constraints in Information Sampling and Utilization</i>, is openly available at <a href='http://doi.org/10.15496/publikation-83023' target="_blank">http://doi.org/10.15496/publikation-83023</a>.

My research centers on quantitative methods in social cognition and judgment and decision-making (JDM). A key theme in my current work is quantifying the informational influence of qualitative information—such as those generated by large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini—on human JDM.
