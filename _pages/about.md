My name is Tobias Rebholz. I am a quantitative psychologist and econometrician working as a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href='https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/174183'>Social Cognition and Decision Sciences</a> group at the Psychology Department of the University of Tübingen in Germany. I received my PhD in 2023 from the DFG-funded Research Training Group "Statistical Modeling in Psychology" (<a href='https://www.uni-mannheim.de/smip/team/phd-candidates/cohort-2020/tobias-rebholz/'>SMiP</a>), a transregional collaboration of researchers from the Universities of Mannheim, Freiburg, Heidelberg, Landau, and Tübingen. 

My research interests include quantitative methods, social cognition, and judgment and decision-making, especially in the context of information sampling and utilization. My doctoral thesis was on the "Advanced Statistical Modeling of Ecological Constraints in Information Sampling and Utilization" (<a href='http://doi.org/10.15496/publikation-83023'>http://doi.org/10.15496/publikation-83023</a>). 

More information on my research can be found on this website. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions (<a href='mailto:tobias.rebholz@uni-tuebingen.de'>tobias.rebholz@uni-tuebingen.de</a>)!
